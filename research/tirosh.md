<strong>Questions we aim to answer</strong>
<ul style="padding-left:40px">
<li>How can we best analyze cell diversityand the complex ecosystem of human tumors to develop better cancer treatments?</li>
</ul>
<br>


<strong>What I did</strong>
<ul style="padding-left:40px">
<li>Reanalyzed a published sc-RNASeq dataset containing 15 nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients</li>
<li>Studied Epstein-Barr virus expression at the single cell level to explore how it affects the composition of tumor tissue</li>
</ul>
<br>


<strong>Skills I developed</strong>
<ul style="padding-left:40px">
<li>Basics of R</li>
<li>Comparison of mRNA expression between single cells</li>
</ul>
<br>


<strong>Defining moments</strong>
<ul style="padding-left:40px">
<li>While an enriching experience, since this program was held during the COVID-19 pandemic, every component was moved online. Disappointed and frustrated by the toll the pandemic had taken on my educational opportunities, I discarded computational neuroscience/bioinformatics as an interest to pursue, it wasnâ€™t until I broadened my research experiences (see <a href="https://ardargence.com/research/joy">Joy</a> and <a href="https://ardargence.com/research/voytek">Voytek</a>) that I realized I do find computational neuroscience fascinating from a cognitive/systems/sensory apporach</li>
</ul>
