<strong>Questions we aim to answer</strong>
<ul style="padding-left:40px">
<li>While acute social isolation has shown to induce prosocial behaviors upon re-introduction to a social group, chronic social isolation tends to produce the opposite, antisocial or even aggressive behaviors, this leads us to wonder what is the exact time course of social isolation?</li>
<li>How do different timepoints of social isolation affect the representation of social stimuli in the medial prefrontal cortex?</li>
</ul>
<br>


<strong>What I did</strong>
<ul style="padding-left:40px">
<li>Implemented optogenetic modulation in the medial prefrontal cortex of mice during social behavior</li>
<li>Carried out and analyzed sexual differences in behavior in the timescales of social isolation</li>
<li>Monitored localized neuronal activity and dopaminergic signaling in vivo</li>
<li>Extracted features of pose estimation during social interaction for the development of an unsupervised machine learning modeling</li>
<li>Developed a supervised machine learning model to characterize phenotypic behaviors in mice when given a novel recording</li>
</ul>
<br>


<strong>Skills I developed</strong>
<ul style="padding-left:40px">
<li>Use of deep learning multi-pose animal tracking (<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-022-01426-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SLEAP</a>)</li>
<li>Immunohistochemistry and brain slicing</li>
<li>Estrous swabbing</li>
<li>Social rank and other behavioral testing</li>
<li>Virus injection and fiber photometry implants in the mouse cortex</li>
</ul>
<br>


<strong>Defining moments</strong>
<ul style="padding-left:40px">
<li>Working in a BIG lab after a summer in a really small one provided me with insight on how labs can sometimes work like a machine, the best results come from thoughtful planning and design, as well as extensive communication</li>
<li><strong>Writing my first research proposal</strong> at the Tye Lab gave me the building blocks that I use today to stop and carefully think on what are the current gaps in research and how can I build a plan to address them</li>
<li>I performed my first surgery and familiarized myself with multidisciplinary approaches like optogenetics and performing in vivo electrophysiology, techniques that I now take into account when <strong>reflecting on how to develop a research plan</strong></li>
</ul>
