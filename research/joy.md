Research Question:

Why is this important:

How we studied/What I did? My contributions

What I learned

Skills I  learned/developed

Development of a pipeline to analyzed cortex-wide in-vivo two-photon calcium imaging datasets from a
skilled reaching task in healthy rodents over a hundred trials, this pipeline will be used to compare
circuit interactions in the brain post stroke
Benchmarked two Open-Source computational toolboxes for calcium imaging recordings on large
volumes of data to determine time-locked neuronal activity and task related changes in fluorescence
Presented results at the JAX SSP 2023 Symposium to share advancements and discuss future
directions
