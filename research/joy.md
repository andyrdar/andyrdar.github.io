<strong>Questions we aim to answer</strong>
<ul style="padding-left:40px">
<li>How do circuits rewire after a stroke and what are the consequence of these rewiring processes on brain function?</li>
<li>How do cortical neurons remap post injury in areas pertaining to motor planning and execution?</li>
</ul>
<br>


<strong>What I did</strong>
<ul style="padding-left:40px">
<li>Developed a pipeline to analyze cortex-wide in vivo two-photon calcium imaging datasets of a motor task in mice</li>
<li>Benchmarked two open-source computational toolboxes for large scale calcium imaging</li>
<li>Analyzed changes in fluorescence across time</li>
<li>Presented my results at the Jackson Laboratory Summer Symposium</li>
</ul>
<br>


<strong>Skills I developed</strong>
<ul style="padding-left:40px">
<li>Calcium imaging analysis in Suite2p and CaImAn</li>
<li>Image processing and motion reduction</li>
<li>Writing academic research reports</li>
</ul>
<br>


<strong>Defining moments</strong>
<ul style="padding-left:40px">
<li>This experience was the first time I presented outside of my local institution, a big step towards learning how to <strong>confidently talk about my science</strong></li>
<li>Working full time on computational analysis as opposed to the short intervals that I get to work on during the academic year made me realize that <strong>graduate school is the right path for me</strong>, since I will be able to dedicate my time to answering questions I find interesting </li>
<li>Informal conversations over the summer with JAX researchers demonstrated me that <strong>there is no one-true-path to becoming a succesful investigator</strong>, everyone has different life trajectories but the same curiosity-driven spirit that guides them to a career in science </li>
</ul>
