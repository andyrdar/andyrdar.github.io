experience in voytek lab

Throughout my freshman year of college, my coursework provided me with a vastly interdisciplinary view of understanding the brain. Inspired by this, I actively sought opportunities to gain hands-on experience in neuroscience research. This led me to seek a position in Dr. Brad Voytekâ€™s computational neuroscience laboratory as an undergraduate researcher. Here, my work quantified neural oscillation features and aperiodic activity from electrophysiological recordings of macaque visual cortex. Under the guidance of a graduate student from the lab, I built upon the knowledge of statistics and programming I had acquired in my classes to implement the computational tools used in the lab into my analysis. By use of these computational approaches, I contributed to the design of open-source packages designed to parametrize neural power spectra, which ultimately revealed features of these neural signals that would have otherwise gone undetected using traditional analysis techniques. 

Joining the Voytek lab was the breaking point in helping shape my desire to pursue research in computational neuroscience. 

The collaborative environment at the Voytek Lab and translational approaches in computational neuroscience ignited in me a passion for research in cognition. Learning in an environment where open science is encouraged, creativity flourishes as we challenge our ideas with a meticulous eye. The Voytek Lab showed me a new face of research I had not seen before, reinforcing what type of researcher I aspire to be.
