<strong>Questions we aim to answer</strong>
<ul style="padding-left:40px">
<li>What are the biological mechanisms underlying the transition to drug addiction?</li>
<li>Can we genetically identify the basis of vulnerability to compulsive cocaine or oxycodone abuse?</li>
<li>What are the effects of chronic nicotine use on the central metabolic system and appetite regulation?</li>
</ul>
<br>


<strong>What I did</strong>
<ul style="padding-left:40px">
<li>Conducted self-administration experiments in rats for our genome-wide association studies</li>
<li>Characterized cocaine or oxycodone addiction-like behaviors in heterogeneous stock rats</li>
<li>Analyzed FOS immunihistochemistry activation in multiple rat brain regions</li>
<li>Performed a statistical analysis of the timecourse of compulsive drug seeking behavior</li>
</ul>
<br>


<strong>Skills I developed</strong>
<ul style="padding-left:40px">
<li>Routine handling of laboratory rodents, collection of diagnostic samples, tail marking, record keeping, weekly weighting and behavioral assays</li>
<li>IP injections</li>
<li>Use of ImageJ for identification of neuronal activation</li>
<li>Statistical analysis using the programming language R</li>
</ul>
<br>


<strong>Defining moments</strong>
<ul style="padding-left:40px">
<li>Since I was unfamiliar with working at a wet lab prior to this experience, our addiction studies gave me the background necessary to feel confident handling animals in different states of arousal and stress</li>
<li>My first time presenting at a research conference I felt excited, but also intimidated, I was only a sophmore and I felt like most of the people around me were far more experienced. Additionally, since English is not my first language, I was concerned my public wouldnâ€™t understand what I was saying, yet the support of my peers and mentors helped me overcome my doubts and present my research successfully</li>
</ul>
