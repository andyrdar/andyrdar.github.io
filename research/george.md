<strong>Questions we aim to answer</strong>
<ul style="padding-left:40px">
<li>How do circuits rewire after a stroke and what are the consequences of these rewiring processes on brain function?</li>
<li>How do cortical neurons remap post injury in areas pertaining to motor planning and execution?</li>
</ul>
<br>



Analyzed FOS immunihistochemistry activation following acute nicotine intake in nicotine self-administering animals. Characterized cocaine or oxycodone addiction-like behavior to identify the neurocircuitry meddiating the effects of drug addiction.

Routine handling of laboratory rodents, collection of diagnostic samples, tail marking, record keeping,
weekly weighting and behavioral assays
Statistical data analysis of substance addictive behavior in Excel, Python and R
Presentation of research advancements alongside colleagues to internal laboratory environment
Preparing rodent subjects to receive chemical stimulants through self administration upon active lever
presses
