  <div style="flex: 1;">
    <p>My professional aspirations are pursuing a doctoral study in cognitive computational neuroscience. I am currently fascinated by how cognition is shaped by interactions between neural circuits, specifically by how electrophysiological signals relating to cognitive processes can inform how these interactions occur at the circuit-level. </p>
    
    <p>To prepare for a research career in neuroscience and equip myself with the necessary knowledge and skills, I am majoring in cognitive and behavioral neuroscience.</p>

My views on the value of diversity in science have been shaped by a combination of personal experiences, observations of global disparities, and active efforts to bridge gaps in knowledge and opportunities. These experiences fuel my commitment to promoting diversity and inclusion in science.
