    <p>My professional aspirations are pursuing a doctoral study in cognitive computational neuroscience to further create <b>visual cortical prosthetics that will aid in vision restoration.</b></p>
    
    <p>How does the brain encode what we see? Can we reverse-engineer this process to evoke images through electrical stimulation? I am fascinated by how cognition is shaped by interactions between neural circuits, specifically by how electrophysiological signals relating to cognitive processes can inform how these interactions occur at the circuit-level.</p>

As of now, I am a senior at the <a href="https://cogsci.ucsd.edu/undergraduates/major/cbn.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">University of California, San Diego</a> majoring in cognitive and behavioral neuroscience and studying non-oscillatory neural activity as a research assistant in the lab of <a href="https://voyteklab.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Dr. Brad Voytek </a>.

Growing up in southern Mexico I was surrounded by nature and culture,

My views on the value of diversity in science have been shaped by a combination of personal experiences, observations of global disparities, and active efforts to bridge gaps in knowledge and opportunities. These experiences fuel my commitment to promoting diversity and inclusion in science.
