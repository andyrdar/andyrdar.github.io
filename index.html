<h3>My identity as a <a style="font-weight:bold; color:#833F51">researcher</a></h3>
<p style="margin-left:5%;">My <a href="https://andyrdar.github.io/research/" class="special-link" style="text-decoration: underline;">research as an 
  early-career neuroscientist</a> is driven by a fascination to understand how cognition and visual perception 
  are shaped by interactions between neural circuits, specifically by how electrophysiological signals 
  relating to cognitive processes can guide future neurotechnologies.
</p>

<h3>My identity as a <a style="font-weight:bold; color:#833F51">science communicator</a></h3>
<p style="margin-left:5%;">Rooted in social and cultural anthropology, a major goal of mine is to <a href="https://andyrdar.github.io/outreach/" 
  class="special-link" style="text-decoration: underline;">empower and create a support network for underrepresented students.</a> Follow me 
  on my journey to foster diversity inside and outside of science! 
</p>

<h3>My identity as a <a style="font-weight:bold; color:#833F51">human</a></h3>
<p style="margin-left:5%;">I love <a href="https://andyrdar.github.io/projects/" class="special-link" style="text-decoration: underline;">humanity.</a> How we 
  build metaphors and romanticize our existence because we are able to recognize how beautiful it actually is 
  that we are alive right this instant. But mainly, love, and everything that comprises it. Which really, is everything 
  that exists. Understanding people and loving them in the process, caring and seeing and existing and listening and sharing, all of it.

<p>How we build metaphors and romanticize our existence because we are able to recognize how beautiful it actually is 
  that we are alive right this instant. But mainly, love, and everything that comprises it. Which really, is everything 
  that exists. How do you choose to love? When do you feel the most loved? When was the first time you truly felt loved?
  Understanding people and loving them in the process, caring and seeing and existing and listening and sharing, all of it.

  Passion is such a strong word to me. When do you feel warmth? What ignites your drive? There are some simple things 
  that come to mind that merge hobbies and likes, they could be subjectively called passions: flowers, smiles, cooking. 
  But I also feel like there's this deeper feeling, more closely related to what can be copmmonly defined as passion, 
  a constant in both what drives my actions and feels grander than myself.

  My path as a scientist has been greatly enriched by shared experiences with individuals who find motivation from uplifting others. 
  Being in an environment surrounded by people who, like me, are familiar with the challenges that come with being an 
  underrepresented student researcher, motivated me to play an active role in fostering diversity within academia. 
  I strongly believe that geographical and economic factors should not impose a constrain when pursuing a passion
